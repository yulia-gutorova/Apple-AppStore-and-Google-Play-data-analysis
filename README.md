# Python Jupiter Data Analysis Project

In this project, I analyzed data about mobile apps from Apple AppStore and Google Play. 

The goal for this project was to help developers to understand what types of apps are more perspective.

Project ideas are based on  [DataQuest.io](https://www.dataquest.io/path/data-analyst/) data-analyst training path.
